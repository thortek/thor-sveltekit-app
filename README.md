# Thor's SvelteKit app

Insecure Questions component: [`InsecureQuestions.svelte`](https://github.com/thortek/thor-sveltekit-app/tree/main/src/lib/components/InsecureQuestions.svelte).

This is where you can find the code for my Insecure Questions component. I will be using this component in my SvelteKit app.
